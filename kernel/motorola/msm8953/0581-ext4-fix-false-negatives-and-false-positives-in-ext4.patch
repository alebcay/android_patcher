Subject: [PATCH 581/591] ext4: fix false negatives *and* false positives in
 ext4_check_descriptors()

commit 44de022c4382541cebdd6de4465d1f4f465ff1dd upstream.

Ext4_check_descriptors() was getting called before s_gdb_count was
initialized.  So for file systems w/o the meta_bg feature, allocation
bitmaps could overlap the block group descriptors and ext4 wouldn't
notice.

For file systems with the meta_bg feature enabled, there was a
fencepost error which would cause the ext4_check_descriptors() to
incorrectly believe that the block allocation bitmap overlaps with the
block group descriptor blocks, and it would reject the mount.

Fix both of these problems.

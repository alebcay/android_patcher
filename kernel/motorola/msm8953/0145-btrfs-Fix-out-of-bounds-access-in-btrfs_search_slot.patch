Subject: [PATCH 145/307] btrfs: Fix out of bounds access in btrfs_search_slot

[ Upstream commit 9ea2c7c9da13c9073e371c046cbbc45481ecb459 ]

When modifying a tree where the root is at BTRFS_MAX_LEVEL - 1 then
the level variable is going to be 7 (this is the max height of the
tree). On the other hand btrfs_cow_block is always called with
"level + 1" as an index into the nodes and slots arrays. This leads to
an out of bounds access. Admittdely this will be benign since an OOB
access of the nodes array will likely read the 0th element from the
slots array, which in this case is going to be 0 (since we start CoW at
the top of the tree). The OOB access into the slots array in turn will
read the 0th and 1st values of the locks array, which would both be 0
at the time. However, this benign behavior relies on the fact that the
path being passed hasn't been initialised, if it has already been used to
query a btree then it could potentially have populated the nodes/slots arrays.

Fix it by explicitly checking if we are at level 7 (the maximum allowed
index in nodes/slots arrays) and explicitly call the CoW routine with
NULL for parent's node/slot.

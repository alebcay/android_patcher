Subject: [PATCH 135/307] kvm: x86: fix KVM_XEN_HVM_CONFIG ioctl
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

[ Upstream commit 51776043afa415435c7e4636204fbe4f7edc4501 ]

This ioctl is obsolete (it was used by Xenner as far as I know) but
still let's not break it gratuitously...  Its handler is copying
directly into struct kvm.  Go through a bounce buffer instead, with
the added benefit that we can actually do something useful with the
flags argument---the previous code was exiting with -EINVAL but still
doing the copy.

This technically is a userspace ABI breakage, but since no one should be
using the ioctl, it's a good occasion to see if someone actually
complains.

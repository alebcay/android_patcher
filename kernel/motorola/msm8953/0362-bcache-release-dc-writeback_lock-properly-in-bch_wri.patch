Subject: [PATCH 362/363] bcache: release dc->writeback_lock properly in
 bch_writeback_thread()

commit 3943b040f11ed0cc6d4585fd286a623ca8634547 upstream.

The writeback thread would exit with a lock held when the cache device
is detached via sysfs interface, fix it by releasing the held lock
before exiting the while-loop.

Fixes: fadd94e05c02 (bcache: quit dc->writeback_thread when BCACHE_DEV_DETACHING is set)

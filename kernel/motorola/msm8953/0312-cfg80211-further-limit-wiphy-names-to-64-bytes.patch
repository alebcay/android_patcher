Subject: [PATCH 312/331] cfg80211: further limit wiphy names to 64 bytes

commit 814596495dd2b9d4aab92d8f89cf19060d25d2ea upstream.

wiphy names were recently limited to 128 bytes by commit a7cfebcb7594
("cfg80211: limit wiphy names to 128 bytes").  As it turns out though,
this isn't sufficient because dev_vprintk_emit() needs the syslog header
string "SUBSYSTEM=ieee80211\0DEVICE=+ieee80211:$devname" to fit into 128
bytes.  This triggered the "device/subsystem name too long" WARN when
the device name was >= 90 bytes.  As before, this was reproduced by
syzbot by sending an HWSIM_CMD_NEW_RADIO command to the MAC80211_HWSIM
generic netlink family.

Fix it by further limiting wiphy names to 64 bytes.

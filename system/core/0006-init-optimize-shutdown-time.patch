Subject: [PATCH 1/1] init: optimize shutdown time

Android O adds 3 steps for the shutdown sequence, kill services/
vold shutdown/umount. It need more than 700ms to kill services
in which bootanimation will be stopped due to zygote died.
However system turns off backlight at the step "umount" which is
too late to get screen stuck in different interface. So turn
off backlight before the step "kill services".

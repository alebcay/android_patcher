Subject: [PATCH 37/53] ALSA: usb-audio: Skip broken EU on Dell dock USB-audio

commit 1d8d6428d1da642ddd75b0be2d1bb1123ff8e017 upstream.

The Dell Dock USB-audio device with 0bda:4014 is behaving notoriously
bad, and we have already applied some workaround to avoid the firmware
hiccup.  Yet we still need to skip one thing, the Extension Unit at ID
4, which doesn't react correctly to the mixer ctl access.

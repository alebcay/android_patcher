Subject: [PATCH 295/333] media: staging: omap4iss: Include asm/cacheflush.h
 after generic includes

[ Upstream commit 0894da849f145af51bde88a6b84f95b9c9e0bc66 ]

Including asm/cacheflush.h first results in the following build error
when trying to build sparc32:allmodconfig, because 'struct page' has not
been declared, and the function declaration ends up creating a separate
(private) declaration of struct page (as a result of function arguments
being in the scope of the function declaration and definition, not in
global scope).

The C scoping rules do not just affect variable visibility, they also
affect type declaration visibility.

The end result is that when the actual call site is seen in
<linux/highmem.h>, the 'struct page' type in the caller is not the same
'struct page' that the function was declared with, resulting in:

  In file included from arch/sparc/include/asm/page.h:10:0,
                   ...
                   from drivers/staging/media/omap4iss/iss_video.c:15:
  include/linux/highmem.h: In function 'clear_user_highpage':
  include/linux/highmem.h:137:31: error:
	passing argument 1 of 'sparc_flush_page_to_ram' from incompatible
	pointer type

Include generic includes files first to fix the problem.

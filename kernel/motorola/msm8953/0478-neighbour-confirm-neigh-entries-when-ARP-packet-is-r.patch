Subject: [PATCH 478/591] neighbour: confirm neigh entries when ARP packet is
 received

[ Upstream commit f0e0d04413fcce9bc76388839099aee93cd0d33b ]

Update 'confirmed' timestamp when ARP packet is received. It shouldn't
affect locktime logic and anyway entry can be confirmed by any higher-layer
protocol. Thus it makes sense to confirm it when ARP packet is received.

Fixes: 77d7123342dc ("neighbour: update neigh timestamps iff update is effective")

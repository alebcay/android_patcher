Subject: [PATCH 241/307] btrfs: Fix possible softlock on single core machines

[ Upstream commit 1e1c50a929bc9e49bc3f9935b92450d9e69f8158 ]

do_chunk_alloc implements a loop checking whether there is a pending
chunk allocation and if so causes the caller do loop. Generally this
loop is executed only once, however testing with btrfs/072 on a single
core vm machines uncovered an extreme case where the system could loop
indefinitely. This is due to a missing cond_resched when loop which
doesn't give a chance to the previous chunk allocator finish its job.

The fix is to simply add the missing cond_resched.

Fixes: 6d74119f1a3e ("Btrfs: avoid taking the chunk_mutex in do_chunk_alloc")

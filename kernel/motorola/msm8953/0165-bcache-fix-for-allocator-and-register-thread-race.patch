[ Upstream commit 682811b3ce1a5a4e20d700939a9042f01dbc66c4 ]

After long time running of random small IO writing,
I reboot the machine, and after the machine power on,
I found bcache got stuck, the stack is:
[root@ceph153 ~]# cat /proc/2510/task/*/stack

The stack shows the register thread and allocator thread
were getting stuck when registering cache device.

I reboot the machine several times, the issue always
exsit in this machine.

I debug the code, and found the call trace as bellow:
register_bcache()
   ==>run_cache_set()
      ==>bch_journal_replay()
         ==>bch_btree_insert()
            ==>__bch_btree_map_nodes()
               ==>btree_insert_fn()
                  ==>btree_split() //node need split
                     ==>btree_check_reserve()
In btree_check_reserve(), It will check if there is enough buckets
of RESERVE_BTREE type, since allocator thread did not work yet, so
no buckets of RESERVE_BTREE type allocated, so the register thread
waits on c->btree_cache_wait, and goes to sleep.

Then the allocator thread initialized, the call trace is bellow:
bch_allocator_thread()
==>bch_prio_write()
   ==>bch_journal_meta()
      ==>bch_journal()
         ==>journal_wait_for_write()
In journal_wait_for_write(), It will check if journal is full by
journal_full(), but the long time random small IO writing
causes the exhaustion of journal buckets(journal.blocks_free=0),
In order to release the journal buckets,
the allocator calls btree_flush_write() to flush keys to
btree nodes, and waits on c->journal.wait until btree nodes writing
over or there has already some journal buckets space, then the
allocator thread goes to sleep. but in btree_flush_write(), since
bch_journal_replay() is not finished, so no btree nodes have journal
(condition "if (btree_current_write(b)->journal)" never satisfied),
so we got no btree node to flush, no journal bucket released,
and allocator sleep all the times.

Through the above analysis, we can see that:
1) Register thread wait for allocator thread to allocate buckets of
   RESERVE_BTREE type;
2) Alloctor thread wait for register thread to replay journal, so it
   can flush btree nodes and get journal bucket.
   then they are all got stuck by waiting for each other.

Hua Rui provided a patch for me, by allocating some buckets of
RESERVE_BTREE type in advance, so the register thread can get bucket
when btree node splitting and no need to waiting for the allocator
thread. I tested it, it has effect, and register thread run a step
forward, but finally are still got stuck, the reason is only 8 bucket
of RESERVE_BTREE type were allocated, and in bch_journal_replay(),
after 2 btree nodes splitting, only 4 bucket of RESERVE_BTREE type left,
then btree_check_reserve() is not satisfied anymore, so it goes to sleep
again, and in the same time, alloctor thread did not flush enough btree
nodes to release a journal bucket, so they all got stuck again.

So we need to allocate more buckets of RESERVE_BTREE type in advance,
but how much is enough?  By experience and test, I think it should be
as much as journal buckets. Then I modify the code as this patch,
and test in the machine, and it works.

This patch modified base on Hua Ruiâ€™s patch, and allocate more buckets
of RESERVE_BTREE type in advance to avoid register thread and allocate
thread going to wait for each other.

[patch v2] ca->sb.njournal_buckets would be 0 in the first time after
cache creation, and no journal exists, so just 8 btree buckets is OK.

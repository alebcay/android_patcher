Subject: [PATCH 360/363] udlfb: set optimal write delay

commit bb24153a3f13dd0dbc1f8055ad97fe346d598f66 upstream.

The default delay 5 jiffies is too much when the kernel is compiled with
HZ=100 - it results in jumpy cursor in Xwindow.

In order to find out the optimal delay, I benchmarked the driver on
1280x720x30fps video. I found out that with HZ=1000, 10ms is acceptable,
but with HZ=250 or HZ=300, we need 4ms, so that the video is played
without any frame skips.

This patch changes the delay to this value.

Subject: [PATCH 310/333] scsi: vmw_pvscsi: Return DID_RESET for status
 SAM_STAT_COMMAND_TERMINATED

[ Upstream commit e95153b64d03c2b6e8d62e51bdcc33fcad6e0856 ]

Commands that are reset are returned with status
SAM_STAT_COMMAND_TERMINATED. PVSCSI currently returns DID_OK |
SAM_STAT_COMMAND_TERMINATED which fails the command. Instead, set hostbyte
to DID_RESET to allow upper layers to retry.

Tested by copying a large file between two pvscsi disks on same adapter
while performing a bus reset at 1-second intervals. Before fix, commands
sometimes fail with DID_OK. After fix, commands observed to fail with
DID_RESET.
